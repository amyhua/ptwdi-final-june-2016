# Final Project Ideas

Here is a list of some ideas to get you started!

1. Become a consultant

Find a local business or non-profit that has a sub-par website or application internally. Offer to redesign the website (in some cases for free, in other cases you might be able to charge a small amount). Having a "real client" will help prepare you better for the real world of web development and to enter the world of freelancing!

2. Build an interactive resume

Stand out from the crowd by describing your professional career in the form of a game or another format that demonstrates your fluency in coding. Check this one out: http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/ Make sure you include all the elements a traditional resume would: work and education history, relevant skills, contact information, etc.

3. Create an interactive simulation of an operating system

Make an awesome front-end that includes emulation of popular operating system programs, but within a browser! For instance, one student built an iOS emulator with app icons that opened a working "Notes" application, another built an application that emulated the Mac OS X desktop environment and the basic programs contained within. Start with the design, then implement the look of the desktop or home screen. Continue by making a few basic applications like a text editor and photo viewer.

4. Make a fan website for a favorite topic

Crazy for Harry Potter, Dr. Who, the Giants, or the Jets? Make the ultimate fan site. Include a blog, a fan forum, and any other features you think that fans of your chosen topic will enjoy.

5. Board or card game emulator

Build an emulator for your favorite board or card game. Start with the most basic functionality necessary to play the game, then go from there.

6. Create a bit.ly clone

Create a URL shortening website. Users should be able to insert a URL, get a new link for it, then track statistics around the link (number of clicks per day, per week, etc). If you're feeling really creative, possibly also purchase a cheap and short domain for your project!

7. Chat application

Remember the days of AIM and ICQ? Now we have Slack, which is pretty cool, but why don't you work on developing a next-generation chat platform? You'll have to read up on Websockets, but students have built similar applications in the past.

Looking for even more inspiration? Here are some ideas from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3we48y/web_app_ideas_for_the_growing_web_developer):

"
# Body Measurement Journal
This one’s simple: set up a user authentication system, and allow the user to fill in a form with things such as weight, waist measurements, thigh, bicep, etc. Make a second page where all previous entries are submitted. Bonus points: print out a visual graph showing progress over time, and use AJAX to make it a single page app without refreshes.

# Workout Log
In your database, populate it with a long list of exercises, as well as the body parts they target. As the user begins typing in the exercise they did, use AJAX to autocomplete or provide suggestions for the exercise name. Store weight, reps, and sets along with the date. Also provide a historical log that allows the user to view progress and see prior entries. Bonus points: Allow the user to create entire workouts, and all they have to do is go through the list and enter weight, sets, and reps as they complete each exercise.

# Recipe generator
Give a few options in a dropdown list such as protein, carbs, and greens, and then a GENERATE button. Based on selection, randomly select a meal from the database that matches the criteria. Bonus points: utilize amazon S3 storage services to store and load images of food.

# Address Book 2.0
Yeah yeah, address books are done to death…but can you create one with a static sidebar that has new contacts automatically added to the list without refreshing? Make it beautiful, and for bonus points add the Google Maps API to show address or directions if physical address is added. Ask for name, phone number, notes, company, and address for starters.

# RPG Character Generator
Create a database filled with different character classes, stats that fall within each class’ restrictions (wizards could always have low strength but high magic for example), and maybe even a description generator populated with premade sentences pertaining to personality, skill, and history. For an interface, allow the user to select what kind of class or character they’d like, and a ROLL or GENERATE button that will fill in the rest. Bonus points: provide a print button that will produce a printer-friendly version of the character sheet.

# Monster Generator
Same as above, but with monsters.

# SMS Reminder
Using an API like Twilio or Nexmo (or make your own if you think you can), create a simple web app that allows you to enter a phone number, a date and time, and a short message or reminder. This would be a great way to set reminders for yourself in a way that you won’t ignore them.

# Rental Property Manager
This one can be pretty complex. Make an SaaS-style property management app where you can create new entries for every unique apartment. Using Amazon S3, allow users to upload photos of the apartment. Track income, expenses, and tenant information. Keep it simple, yet robust. Bonus points: use uploaded photos and apartment information to generate an ad that can be placed on sites like Zillow, Craigslist, etc. Bonus points part 2: Utilize a payment gateway API like Stripe to accept rent payments online."
